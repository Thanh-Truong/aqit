BEFORE:
I was thinking to have one primary index instance which indexes a file on
block level.
I was thinking to have one secondary index instance per block.

NOW: 
I decided to have only one secondary index instance, which indexes every rows
in a log file. This is a test to see how big the LOFIX-S will be

I don't have time for it... this is put into closet

Change flag to disable mexima. I need to run the system with in memory 
Btree which is easier to rollout

(internalize-code ) --> create an transient object that encapsulates the code produces from externalize-code
(externalize-code ) --> externalize the code that can be sent
(predicate-definition ) --> predicate definition for fno
(theresolvent 'fn) --> get fno  the resolvents of function fn

Currently, when register a node as RawWorker, we associate it with
a pair of datafile, metafile. These files are bound to a specific 
MappedRelation. 

What if we have more than one ?
Principle, each RawWorker works only one pair from a specific MappedRelation.
??????????????
RawWorker's name should reflect this


 (externalize-fndef (predicate-function (selectbody-argl sb)
                        (selectbody-resl sb)
                        (selectbody-pred sb)))


 (externalize-fndef (predicate-function invars
                                        outvars
					pred))
------------------------------------------------------
AMOSQL datatype of transient function is Function

create function create_transfunc()->Function tfn 
 as foreign 'create-transfn';

lisp;

(defun create-transfunc (fno tfn) 
 (osql-result (predicate-function 
      	          (selectbody-argl sb)
 	          (selectbody-resl sb)
		  (selectbody-pred sb))))

:osql
create_transfunc();

Now I have finished "sending subquery" to nodes, but another problem appeared.

In the subquery part, it includes definition of LogFile_MeasuresB. However, the 
spawned nodes does not have the defintion of it. Why ?

  - Look into test-generate-log.lsp
    First, we define a logged data stream.

  - The we do "slasraw:log", this will log the comming data stream into chunks
    together with the metadata saved as database image (Meta-data builder node)
   
    However, the Meta-data builder node was spawned with slasraw.dmp which ofcourse,
    did not contain the newly defined LogFile_MeasuresB


Solution:
a) When defining "LogFile_MeasuresB" this will be saved into the current database
   image.

   Then Meta-data builder is spawned with exactly the same image.

   What happens if people do rollback or define more things on the fly.

b) 
(osql "register('me');"

(osql "updateState(\"set :s = streamof(csv_file_tuples('measuredB.txt'));\");")                  

(osql "updateState(\"set :lds = define_loggedstream(:s, 'LogFile_MeasuresB',
                                            {'m', 's', 'bt', 'et', 'mv'}, 
                                            {4}, 3);\");")  

(osql "slasraw:log(:s, :lds);")

I modified slas/raw/slaslogger/Makefile...at revision 166 --> 167
2014-03-19
What did I need to change on Windows
 
In AmosNT\C\scsq.h I put EXPORT in front of init_scsq
In AmosNT\validate\swin.c I remove definition of swincell ... by #include "swinCh.h"

In AmosNT\validate\MVC\swin.dsw is changed
In AmosNT\scsq\MVC\scsqlib.dsw is changed
